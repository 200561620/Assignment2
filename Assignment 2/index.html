                Summertime<br>
                And the livin' is easy<br>
                Fish are jumpin'<br>
                And the cotton is high<br>
                Oh, your daddy's rich<br>
                And your ma is good-lookin'<br>
                So hush, little baby<br>
                Don't you cry<br>
            </p>

                One of these mornings<br>
                You're going to rise up singing<br>
                Then you'll spread your wings<br>
                And you'll take the sky<br>
                But 'til that morning<br>
                There's a'nothing can harm you<br>
                With daddy and mammy standing by<br>
